				<h2>About Us</h2>
				<p>Sound Bar was founded on the vision of a dedicated group of individuals with the goal of bringing music lovers everywhere a one-stop shop where they can find valuable information about the artists they love and where to see them next.</p>

				<p> The idea for Sound Bar was founded in a class room much like the one you may be sitting in now. Actually very likely it was on the same campus you are currently on. The idea only took  a few hours to decide upon and the product took merely a week to put together, but as you can see - the results speak for themselves. </p>

				<h2>Our Mission</h2>

				SoundBar will change the way you discover and listen to music. Powered by the Music Genome ApiÂ©, the second-most comprehensive music analysis ever undertaken, SoundBar gives you non-personalized data-base information about the artists you love - and stores them on a database somewhere you'll never see.

				<p> Currently a 22 year old student at Washburn University. Learning code as it is becoming an essential skill to have in society and is the reason I pursued an internship over the summer at KU Med's Center for Telemedicine and Telehealth. I'm excited to learn more and one day start a career in the field.

				<p>I'm an API/AJAX master. If you need to know anything about any musical artist out there - I won't know the answer. But I can build one hell of a website that would give you that information - and here it is.</p>

				<p>My life currently consists of solving problems in the advertising world at a local agency called Sandbox and then coming home to solve problems in the world of html, css an javascript. When not in front of a monitor - you can usually find me on a golf course, kayaking down a river attempting to catch some fish, or fixing something in my house!</p>
